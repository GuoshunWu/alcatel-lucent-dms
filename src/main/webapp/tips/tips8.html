<h2>How to add and apply glossary?</h2>
Glossary settings can be found at "Settings"->"Glossary". You can click "+" button to add a new glossary. After new glossary items are added, they're not applied to all existing labels in DMS immediately, you must click on "Apply Glossary" button in order that new glossaries will be applied.<br/>
But once glossary item has been added in DMS, then this glossary item will automatically be applied to labels in any new dictionaries imported later or new translation result uploaded into DMS later. This is done automatically.<p/>
Explanation of the "Need translation" flag:<br/>
For glossary items, capitalization style will always be applied, no matter the translation flag is true or false. The only difference for glossary items with translation flag set to true is that when reference text = glossary text, DMS will not set [Exclusion] context.<br/>
So you must set the translation flag to false for acronyms or abbreviations, for which no translation is needed. Otherwise, set the flag to true.
