<h2>How DMS save translation cost?</h2>
Firstly, DMS share translations across product/applications. When dictionary files containing new labels are imported, DMS will search existing translation for new labels in the database. If existing translation found, then the new labels are automatically translated. Secondly, DMS also manage the duplicate. So when create translation task, DMS send only one instance for translation for all labels with same reference text, so translation is done only one time.
