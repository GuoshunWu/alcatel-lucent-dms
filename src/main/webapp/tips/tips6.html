<h2>How to add new language?</h2>
Traditional way is to create dictionary files for the new languages (must be copy of dictionary file for GAE or English) and then import the dictionary package again into DMS. But it is recommended to directly add a new language in DMS, which will be much easier: in dictionary management, select dictionary files first, and then click on "add language" button to add any new languages you want. When you select a language, a language code will be automatically given by DMS. And as soon as new language is added, some labels are automatically translated for this new language immediately by DMS.
