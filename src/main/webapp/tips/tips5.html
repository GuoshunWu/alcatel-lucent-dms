<h2>How DMS set translation state during dictionary import?</h2>
Some dictionary format use a translation flag to indicate the label has been translated so no translation is needed or the label is new so translated is needed. If there is such translation flag for each label in dictionary file, then during the import, DMS will read the translation flag and set translation state (translated or not translated) for the labels accordingly.<p/>
If there is not such translation flag in the dictionary files, then DMS use the simple logic to indicate if the label has been translated or not. If the translation text is identical to the reference text (GEA or EN), then DMS considers that it is not translated (translation state is set to “not translated”). If the translation text is different than the reference text, then DMS considers that it is translated (translation state is set to “translated”).<p/>
When some dictionary files are already translated when we import them into DMS first time, but there are some translated labels, whose language text is identical to reference text (especially for some Latin languages), in this case, we can easily filter those labels whose translation text is identical to reference text and manually set translation state to “translated” for these labels in a batch operation. This need to be done only one time, and DMS will remember the translation state if we continue to import the same dictionary files in the future, unless the reference text for the label is changed.
