<h2>What is DICT context?</h2>
Due to historic reason, some dictionaries are already translated before imported into DMS. And sometimes, the translation result for the same reference text is different. So when the dictionary files are imported into DMS, for each label, DMS will compare current translation with translation in DEFAULT context, if the translation is different in at least one language, then DMS will automatically assign a DICT context for this label, in order not to change the current translation.
