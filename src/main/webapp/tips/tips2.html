<h2>What is context?</h2>
In DMS, we use context to define the scope of the sharing of translations. Labels in the same context always share the same translation if they have same reference text. <br/>
By default, if there is no context information in the dictionary file imported to DMS, then DMS will assign DEFAULT context to the labels. DEFAULT context means there is no context. If for the same reference text, a different translation must be given (for example, the word "second" can have 2 different meanings and translation: the order or the time.), then we must give different context to the label. <br/>
In some dictionary format, there is context information in dictionary file. So DMS can read context during import. If there is no context information in the dictionary files, we can also directly set or modify context in DMS (Dictionary Management View => String Settings).
