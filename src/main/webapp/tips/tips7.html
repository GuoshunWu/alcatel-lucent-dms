<h2>What is glossary?</h2>
The glossary is designed to ensure consistent capitalization style of terminologies and add acronyms or abbreviations for which no translation is needed. 
That means:
<ul>
<li>If reference text or translation text of the label contains glossary text, then capitalization style will be applied to the glossary text, which appears in the reference text or translation text of the label.</li>
<li>If reference text in a label is identical to glossary text and the glossary has "need translation" flag set to false, then DMS will automatically set [Exclusion] context for this label. (but if glossary text is only a part of the reference text, then DMS will not set the [Exclusion] context)</li>
</ul>
