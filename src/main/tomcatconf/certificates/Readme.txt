Alcatel-Lucent PKI Certificates and CRLs


In order to secure business communication with Alcatel-Lucent based on e-mail, you need to trust the Alcatel-Lucent Public Key Infrastructure.

Depending on your configuration, this can be done by registering the Alcatel-Lucent Authority's certificates into your browser, mail client or operating system. Don't forget to grant the relevant trust level for each type of certificates. For secure email, you'll need to download the Alcatel-Lucent Root CA and the Alcatel-Lucent Internal CA certificates.

Another way to get these certificates is to accept & trust them all, the first time you receive a signed email from an Alcatel-Lucent counterpart that you know and trust.
You can obtain the appropriate Certificates by selecting from the following:
Alcatel-Lucent Internal Root CA [mandatory](rootCA)
Alcatel-Lucent Internal SSL Sub CA(SSLsubCA)
Alcatel-Lucent Internal Sub CA(subCA)
Alcatel-Lucent AD Internal SSL Sub CA (ADSSLsubCA)
Alcatel-Lucent AD Internal Sub CA(ADsubCA)

The Certificate Revocation List for all CA are also available:
Alcatel-Lucent Internal Root CA CRL(rootCA.crl)
Alcatel-Lucent Internal SSL Sub CA CRL(SSLsubCA.crl)
Alcatel-Lucent Internal Sub CA CRL
Alcatel-Lucent AD Internal SSL Sub CA CRL
Alcatel-Lucent AD Internal Sub CA CRL

To download the CRL, you have to right-click on it and save the target or link to a file. Then open the file by double-clicking it.
