LANGUAGES {CHK, GAE, FR0, EN0, DE0, IT0, PT0, ES0, US0, PL0, KO0, NO0, NL0, RU0, CH0, FI0, ES1, CS0, HU0, CH1, SV0, AR0, DA0, HE0}

-- Structure of the dictionary:

-- First, you can see commentary lines, precedeed by two minus signs "--". these comments are not
-- interpreted by the dictionary tool.

-- For each translation needed, you will find:
-- An entry key string in upper case, followed by a colon ":".
-- This key is used by the software to associate a text field in the application with a set of
-- translations
-- Each translation associated with this key enholds:
-- - a language code (FR0 for French for instance)
-- - a text between brackets for the translation
-- - a comma to delimit the end of the translation for this language
-- the comma is replaced by a semicolon ";" to end the list of translations for a specific key

-- NOTA 1: The CHK (Czech) language is used for indicating the maximum width of a text field.
-- This indication stands only if you visualize the present dictionary with the proper
-- font (as used in the application). Then, whichever characters you are using
-- (W can be wider than i) the translations in the different languages  must not exeed the text width
-- (undependantly to the characters amount) indicated in the CHK field
-- Texts that are to be displayed in a popup window (OK popup, yes-no popup...) can consist
-- of more than one line:
-- "This text will be displayed""on two lines"
-- Each line must not exceed the width indicated in the CHK field
-- Texts that are to be displayed in a temporised popup (also called timed popup) can consist of :
-- One (long) line (with automatic wrap of text on the following 3 lines),
-- Or several lines ("First line"Second line"...up to "Forth line")
-- In any case, you are limited to 256 caracters.

-- General syntax:
-- WC_xxxx : Window caption (title of the window)
-- ME_xxxx : element of a menu
-- BU_xxxx : name of a button
-- CB_xxxx : element of a combo-box
-- TQ_xxxx : text of a question
-- TI_xxxx : text of an information, a warning, a problem
-- ST_xxxx : static text before a variable field or others....
-- EN_xxxx : for enumered types
-- TT_xxxx : tool tips

-- General rules:
-- the "%s" inserted in a string will be replaced by a text at execution;
-- the "%d" inserted in a string will be replaced by a number;
-- all the translation for a string including a %s or a %d must keep those key characters, or an error occurs.
-- The translations being presented in two string ("like" "this") will be displayed on two lines;
-- you are not allowed to translate on two lines a text which is in one line in the English translation.

-- Text displayed if the translation is not found
-- nota: Sometimes the default text is included in English in the source code, beginning with "?"
